# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project - Coursera

This repo was created for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. It contains code to work with the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" which can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). (see also Citation below)



## Description

This repo contains a script called *run_analysis.R*. The purpose of this script is to combine the various files of the datset into a single tidy dataset with descriptive variable names and to extract only the values of the means and standard deviations of the measurements. This dataset has the variable name `tidy_data_tot`.
